# HTTP API INVOKER

**Make HTTP api invokes as natural and elegant as calling local methods.** 

Binding HTTP url to interface, the framework will generate a proxy class which send HTTP request and handle response when we call the interface's method. Generic is supported.

The only thing we need to do is defining the interface.

# FEATURE

1. Just define interface, and the framework provide the proxy implement like MyBatis.
2. Light-weigh.
3. Upload and download file is supported.
4. Autowired annotation is supported if integrate with Spring.
5. Well documented and unit tested.
6. Mock supported
7. JDK6+ (1.2.0 and above)

# TECHNOLOGY STACK
 
* dynamic proxy
* reflection
* annotation
* auto package scanning

# GET STARTED
 
## I. Add maven dependency

```xml
 <dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.dadiyang</groupId>
    <artifactId>http-api-invoker</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
 </dependency>
```

## II. Define interface

Provided `http://localhost:8080/city/allCities` response: 
```json
[
    {
        "id":1,
        "name":"beijing"
    },
    {
        "id":2,
        "name":"shanghai"
    }
]
```

Define an interface like this: 
```java
@HttpApi
public interface CityService {
    @HttpReq("http://localhost:8080/city/allCities")
    List<City> getAllCities();
}
```

## III. Get proxy
 
### HttpApiProxyFactory

Now we can get a proxy implement of the interface by calling

`CityService cityService = HttpApiProxyFactory.getProxy(CityService.class)`

And just use this instance to send a request to the HTTP api:

`List<City> cities = cityService.getAllCities()`

### Spring Integration

#### Configuration

Add @HttpApiScan to a @Configuration class for enabling package scanning.

```java
@Configuration
@HttpApiScan
public class TestApplication {
}
```
 
#### Autowired the interface

```java
@Autowired
private CityService cityService;

public void test() {
    List<City> cities = cityService.getAllCities();
    for (City city : cities) {
        System.out.println(city.getId() + ", " + city.getName());
    }
}
```

Note: if your IDE complain "Could not autowired. no beans of type 'xxx' type found", just ignore that message.

## IV. PLACEHOLDER

Placeholder is supported for reading config properties (using **${}**, like ${api.url.city}) and path variables (using **{}**, like {cityName}). 

Note: Params matched the path variables will be removed from the request body, but we can use placeholder **#{id}** to keep it.

We can use placeholder in **@HttpApi's prefix and @HttpReq's url**.

Note：
    
- path variable using **`{}`**, 
- path variable and keep it in request params using **`#{}`**,
- and config using **`${}`**.
- set default value through : , such as ${api.url.city:beijing} {cityId:1} #{cityId:}

The framework will get the config property from: 

* **property file** set by **configPaths** in @HttpApiScan,
* **System property**: System.getProperty("property"),
* and **Spring Environment** in Spring integration scenario.

## V. Retry policy

In some cases, we need to retry a request if network is not available, response status code is not 2xx etc. We can use `@RetryPolicy` annotation to indicate that this method need to be retry when an unexpected condition occur. It can be annotated on method and class. The class's policy prior to the method's. 

* times: try times, 3 by default;
* retryFor: what exception to retry, IOException by default;
* retryForStatus: what status code would retry, other than 20x by default;
* fixedBackOffPeriod: back off strategy, the number of seconds to sleep when retry is required, not to sleep by default.


## VI. EXTENSION

### RequestPreprocessor

Sometimes, we need to get all request added some specific headers, cookies or params.

It would be redundant to add these stuff.

Now we can register a RequestPreprocessor. RequestPreprocessor's process() method will be call when a request is prepared but not yet send.

We are provided a chance to access the request and set anything we need. 

```java
public void preprocessorTest() {
    HttpApiProxyFactory factory = new HttpApiProxyFactory(request -> {
        // we add cookie and header for all request invoked by the proxy get from this factory
        request.addCookie("authCookies", authKey);
        request.addHeader("authHeaders", authKey);
        // get current proxied method from CURRENT_METHOD_THREAD_LOCAL
        Method method = CURRENT_METHOD_THREAD_LOCAL.get();
    });
    CityService cityService = factory.getProxy(CityService.class);
    City city = cityService.getCity(id);
}
```

or in Spring scenario, register a RequestPreprocessor Bean.


### ResponseProcessor

Similar to RequestPreprocessor, ResponseProcessor enable us to get access to take over the response by implementing the ResponseProcessor interface.

```java
ResponseProcessor cityResultProcessor = (response, method) -> {
    ResultBean<City> cityResultBean = JSON.parseObject(response.getBody(), 
            new TypeReference<ResultBean<City>>() {
    });
    return cityResultBean.getData();
};
HttpApiProxyFactory factory = new HttpApiProxyFactory(cityResultProcessor);
CityService cityServiceWithResponseProcessor = factory.getProxy(CityService.class);
City city = cityServiceWithResponseProcessor.getCity(id);
```

or in Spring scenario, register a RequestPreprocessor Bean.

Usually, an HTTP api would response a ResultBean formed with code/msg/data fields, like: 

```json
{
    "code": 0, 
    "data": {
        "name": "Hello"
    },
    "msg or message": "xx"
}
```

We provided a `ResultBeanResponseProcessor` for this scenario. 

It will check the code specify by @ExpectedCode annotation or 0 by default. 

If the code in response body is not equals to the expected one, an IllegalStateException will be thrown.

If they are equal, the data field will be parse to return value, unless the method do not need it or its return type is a ResultBean.

# CORE ANNOTATION

## @HttpApiScan

Enable package scanning similar to @ComponentScan

* value: to set basePackage，the annotated class's package by default
* configPaths: to specify config files

## @HttpApi

Declare a class it HTTP api binding class which need to be scanned. Similar to Spring's @Component

## @HttpReq

Set the url and request method (GET/POST/DELETE etc.) binding to the method.

## @Param

value: the key of request param
isBody: mark that the argument is the request body, if the argument is an non-primary object, all the field-value will be a part of request params.

value and isBody should not both be empty/false, otherwise the param will be ignored

## @Headers

Headers of the request, must be `Map<String, String>` otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

## @Cookies

Cookies of the request, must be `Map<String, String>` otherwise an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

## @Form

indicate a method or all methods in a class would send a form request, Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded.

## @RetryPolicy

Retry policy can be annotated to both class and method.

* times: try times, 3 by default;
* retryFor: what exception to retry, IOException by default;
* retryForStatus: what status code would retry, other than 20x by default;
* fixedBackOffPeriod: back off strategy, the number of seconds to sleep when retry is required, not to sleep by default.
